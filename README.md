I am an optimization scientist focused on developing robust mathematical models and algorithms to deliver efficient solutions for challenging decision problems, primarily within the domains of supply chain, logistics, and transportation.

In my master's thesis, I conducted an in-depth study on the collaborative consolidation of shipments among shippers with varying characteristics, with a special focus on inventory costs and cooperation.

With three years of experience as a production planning engineer, I have honed my skills in scheduling and supply chain planning. During this time, I gained valuable insights into the significance of sustainable business processes, the importance of accurate data collection, and the ability to extract meaningful insights from data analysis. These experiences have ingrained in me the ability to make informed decisions and strive for optimal outcomes.
