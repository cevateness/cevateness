I am an optimization scientist focused on developing robust mathematical models and algorithms to deliver efficient solutions for challenging decision problems, primarily within the domains of supply chain, logistics, and transportation.

In my master's thesis, I conducted an in-depth study on the collaborative consolidation of shipments among shippers with varying characteristics, with a special focus on inventory costs and cooperation.
